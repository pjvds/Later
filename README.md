# Later!

Later! is a Chrome Extension that enables you to bookmark a page to Read It Later.
It adds a small icon to the address bar that you can click to mark the current page for later reading.

## Features

1. Plain dead simple! Just click and forget.
2. Intuitive! Feedback given by icons, no pop ups or other annoying things.
3. Configuration-less! We hate big configuration screens as much as you do.

## How does it work?

1. Click on the ReadItLater icon in the Omnibox (address bar) to mark the current page for later reading.
2. The icon changes to a checkmark when the page was bookmarked.

## Read It Later
